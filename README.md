# Stock Market Forecasting using Machine Learning

This Colab notebook showcases the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting the performance of stock market indices. The project uses data from four different stock market indices worldwide, pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic. The notebook provides an analysis of the data using various time series analysis methods such as Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, LSTM, 1D CNN, and SVR.

## Steps to Run
<ol>
<li>Open the notebook on Google Colab.
<li>Create a new folder in your Google Drive named 'ALDA_project'.
 <li>Inside ALDA_project folder, create a folder named 'Dataset' and store all the datasets there.
<li>Click on "Runtime" in the menu and then click on "Run all".
 </ol>

Wait for the notebook to finish running all cells. The status of each cell will be displayed on the left side of the cell.
Once all cells have been executed, you can start exploring the results and visualizations.

Note1: For training models on different index's data, set the value of i as 0,1,2,3 accordingly. Also, the visualization graphs will be updated accordingly.

Note2: The notebook uses data from an external source, so it may take some time to load the data. Please be patient and wait for the data to load completely before running any cells.

## Requirements
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
<ul>
<li>Pandas
<li>Numpy
<li>Sklearn
<li>Tensorflow
<li>Matplotlib
<li>Plotly
</ul>

All these libraries are pre-installed in Google Colab. However, if you want to run the notebook locally, you need to install these libraries manually.
